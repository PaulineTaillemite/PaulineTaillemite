# 👾 Hello, My name is Pauline !

![Hi](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMXJ6ZTBwN2pkaXhtYTlod3E1MGJibzVhY214NHUzN3RqajNjM2dsOCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/L1R1tvI9svkIWwpVYr/giphy.gif)

👀 I’m passionate about crafting **seamless digital experiences**. For now, my favorite stacks are **React and Tailwind** on the front-end, and **Python/Django** on the back-end.

🌱 I’m currently studying at **Ada Tech School**, a 2-year program to become a **full stack developer**. Ada Tech School follows an **alternative pedagogy** emphasizing **inclusivity** and learning through **hands-on experience**, allowing me to deepen my expertise in front-end technologies while also cultivating my back-end skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **web and mobile app development projects**. I'm particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to work on **creative projects, driven by design**, and continue to learn new languages, stacks, and best practices in Tech.

📫 If you want to reach me ( or offer me an **iced latte**) : pauline.taillemite@gmail.com !

😄 Pronouns: **She/Her**

⚡ Fun facts about me: I have an obsession for getting **platinum trophies** on my games on **PS5**, I've been dancing for **20 years**, and I know where to find the **best lemon meringue pie in Paris**!
