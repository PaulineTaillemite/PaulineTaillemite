- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulineTaillemite
  ![Hi](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlTJXz7pZz1GxA8/giphy.gif)
- 👀 I’m passionate about crafting seamless digital experiences. For now, my favorites stacks are React and Tailwind on the front-end, and Python/Django on the back-end.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Ada Tech School, a 2-year program to become a full stack developer. Ada Tech School follows an alternative pedagogy emphasizing inclusivity and learning through hands-on experience, allowing me to deepen my expertise in front-end technologies while also cultivating my back-end skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web and mobile app development projects. I'm particularly excited about opportunities that allow me work on creative projects, driven by design, and continue to learn new languages, stacks and best practices in Tech.
